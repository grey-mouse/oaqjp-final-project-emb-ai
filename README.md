- Extracted relevant information from the output received from the function

- Packaged and tested the application created

- Completed web deployment of the application using Flask

- Incorporated error handling to account for invalid input to the application

- Written codes that are in a compliance with PEP8 guidelines, getting 10/10 score in static code analysis.
